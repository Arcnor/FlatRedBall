At some point in the late 2010's, the Game1.cs file was unified across all FRB templates. 
Rather than manually maintaining all files, we have a MasterGame.cs file which contains all of the common code. 
Whenever it is changed, Game1Copier.exe should be executed to copy files. But where is Game1Coper.exe source for when we add new templates? Hmm....
