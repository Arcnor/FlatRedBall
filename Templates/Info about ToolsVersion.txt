The .csproj file format is contained within a <Project> tag. This has a ToolsVersion attribute.

Some older FRB templates, such as Android, use a ToolsVersion of 4.0, which I believe matches the msbuild version packaged with .NET 4.X

Some projects, such as UWP, require a newer version of MSBuild, such as 14.0. However, Visual Studio 2017 is packaged with MSBuild 15.0, and that won't work with projects that need 14.0 or 12.0.

So, for any project that uses MSBuild 4.0, we'll leave it at 4.0 (such as Android or XNA)

For any project that requires a specific version of VS, we'll make it 15.0 (which maps to VS 2017).

The reason for this is because I need to pick *a* version of VS to be tied to.

As an alternative, I could also have the new project creator try to adjust the ToolsVersion but...I don't think I'll bother yet. I'll count this document as progress and up everything to 15.0.
